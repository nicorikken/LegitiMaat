          A working method for conducting third-party research into the use of algorithms by a government organization.

    longDescription: >
          With more and more talk about oversight of algorithms, it is important to know how to conduct research
          into algorithms by third parties in such a way that the day-to-day execution processes are not disrupted.

          It is not easy to arrive at such a working method. Not all organizations have a set of algorithms/decision
          rules in natural language, but only computer code that is barely legible for laymen. It also happens that 
          organizations have purchased software (or the use of software) with which laws are implemented and where the 
          supplier is the only one who has the substantive knowledge in-house. However, there are also implementation 
          institutions that have the decision rules in natural language in the drawer. This fact, or promise (?) has 
          led to the idea of investigating these documents.

          In this light, we have developed a working method that enables implementation organizations that use 'simple' 
          algorithms for (automated) decision-making in the performance of their legal tasks to:
          - To test and justify the legitimacy (in a legal and accountable sense) of the algorithms themselves and 
            the decisions based on them;
          - To be transparent about the operation of the algorithms used.
